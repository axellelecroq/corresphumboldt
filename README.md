# About
This project was developp during my internship at the BBAW in the project ["Travelling Humboldt – Science on the Move"](https://edition-humboldt.de/). 
The purpose of this web app is to enrich the [correspSearch](https://correspsearch.net/) data by indicating the link to the archive document for the correspondence of Alexander von Humboldt.

This app was developed with Flask, an open-source web development framework in Python. For the frond-end, the framework Bootstrap (CSS and HTML) was used.

## Features
- The user uploads the CMIF document from correspSearch. 
- It was decided to query Kalliope-Verbund which is probably one of the largest catalogues of archives and libraries in the German-speaking world. The tool developed retrieves data from Kalliope API and searches within it to match the letter corresponding with the one edited and registered on correspSearch.
- Matches considered complete are directly added to the file uploaded by the user. A complete match is based on the GND of the sender, the GND of the receiver, the date of sending and the coverage place.
- Matches for which the location doesn't match must be confirmed (or not) by the user and will then be added to the CMIF file.
- It is possible to upload a CMIF file containing only the complete matches or the user uploaded CMIF file updated with Kalliope links for the matched letters.
