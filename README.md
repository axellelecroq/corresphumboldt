# About
This project was developp during my internship at the BBAW in the project ["Travelling Humboldt â€“ Science on the Move"](https://edition-humboldt.de/). 
The purpose of this web app is to discover the correspondance of Alexander von Humboldt with a searching tool and visualizations.

This app was developed with Flask, an open-source web development framework in Python. For the frond-end, the framework Bootstrap (CSS and HTML) was used.
