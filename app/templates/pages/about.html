            <p class="contentColumn">The user uploads a CMIF file of Alexander von Humboldt letters. The tool performs a query on the
                <a href="https://kalliope-verbund.info/">Kalliope-Verbund</a> API and compares the user's data to it. </p>
            <p class="contentColumn">When a full match is found then the Kalliope's link is added to the user's CMIF file in the <i>correspDesc/@corresp</i>. Possible matches are then proposed to the user who can then confirm or not these matches so that they can be added to
                the file.
            </p>
            <p class="contentColumn">The user has the possibility to download in CMIF format the uploaded file with added Kalliope's links or only a file containing the complete matches.
            </p>
            <p class="contentColumn" style="margin-bottom: 0.4em;"><i>What is a match ?</i></p>
            <p class="contentColumn">The tool compares the data on the sender's
                <a href="https://www.dnb.de/EN/Professionell/Standardisierung/GND/gnd_node.html">GND ID </a> and the receiver's GND ID, the coverage place and the sending date. A complete match means that all four elements match. If it is a possible match,
                i.e. one that needs user evaluation, then all elements match except the coverage place. </p>

            <h4>CMIF: the accepted format</h4>
            <p class="contentColumn">The <i>Correspondence Metadata Interchange Format</i> (CMIF) was developed for editors of digital and printed scholarly editions to provide the most important metadata about edited letters online and in a machine-readable form. CMIF is based
                on the guidelines of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) and was developed within the
                <a href="https://tei-c.org/activities/sig/correspondence/"><i>TEI Correspondence Special Interest Group</i> (SIG)</a>. The format is used on <a href="https://correspsearch.net/">correspSearch</a>.</p>
            <p class="contentColumn"><i>To know more about CMIF format, please read this
                <a href="https://encoding-correspondence.bbaw.de/v1/CMIF.html">article</a>. There are also multiple informations on <a href="https://correspsearch.net/">correspSearch</a>.</i></p>
